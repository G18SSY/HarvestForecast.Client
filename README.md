# HarvestForecast.Client
API client package for Harvest Forecast

Inspired by the unofficial [Go package](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/forecast) for [Harvest Forecast](https://www.getharvest.com/forecast) which I had a quick play with [here](https://github.com/G18SSY/forecast-test). I created this .NET client package as a direct(ish) port of that so it could be used in .NET based projects.

## Installation

This package will be available to install via NuGet once it is complete and tested.
